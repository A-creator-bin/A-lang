# A-lang
A-lang is an open-source programming language created for codes that control software whith the 'door',being high level,like python and js,yet it has control for the hardware with the door

example code:

import example.lib.a
x = 10;
y = "hi";
print(y);
z = x + 123:
print(z);
door ls
door dir
door sudo apt install gcc
door gcc hello.c -o hello

if(x > 10)print("x e maior");else print("x e menor");
while(x < 55){print("ele e maior");x = x - 1;



the libs have to be in the lib folder,ok?
